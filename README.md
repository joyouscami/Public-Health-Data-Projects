### Public Health R Scripts

### Overview

This repository is a collection of R scripts analyzing various public health datasets. It represents my first attempt at sharing code on GitHub, and while some scripts are still a work-in-progress, this repo is a milestone in my journey into data analysis and public health research.

The analyses focus on different aspects of public health, from mental health to maternal health, and studies on key populations. Each script demonstrates exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical testing, and in some cases, predictive modeling.

### Methods Used

Across the scripts, I experimented with:

- Data Cleaning & Transformation (tidyverse)

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): descriptive statistics, cross-tabulations

- Inferential Statistics: t-tests, ANOVA, chi-square tests

- Regression Models: logistic regression, linear regression (where applicable)

- Factor Analysis (psychological & social determinants data)

- Visualization: ggplot2 plots for trends and comparisons

### Datasets

All datasets analyzed here are publicly available on Kaggle and used purely for learning purposes.

    Mental Health: Exploring prevalence and correlates of mental health issues.

    Maternal Health: Investigating factors influencing maternal outcomes.

    Key Populations: Analyzing HIV-related service uptake among vulnerable groups.

▶️ How to Use

 - Clone the repository:

       git clone https://github.com/joyouscami/public-health-data-projects.git
       cd public-health-data-projects


 - Open R or RStudio.

 - Run the scripts in each folder. Adjust dataset file paths if needed.

### Dependencies

 - Install the required R packages before running the scripts:

       install.packages(c("tidyverse", "psych", "car", "broom", "GPArotation"))

### Work in Progress

Some analyses are incomplete — and that’s intentional! This repo documents my learning curve, and I plan to refine, expand, and improve the scripts over time.

### Why This Repo Matters to Me

This was my first GitHub repository, and it represents my first step into:

 - Writing reproducible code in R.

 - Sharing my work publicly.

 - Exploring how data can answer important public health questions.

It’s not perfect, but it’s meaningful — and it’s the starting point for everything I’ve built since.

### Acknowledgments

Thanks to the organizations and researchers who made these datasets publicly available, allowing learners like me to practice and grow.
